🧪 Manual Testing Projects (Web & Mobile Applications)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of manual Quality Assurance (QA) test cases created for sample web and mobile applications. The project demonstrates hands-on experience in manual testing, covering core application modules such as Login, Signup/Registration, Dashboard, and Communication (Chat & Notifications).

The test cases are written using an industry-standard test case format, including fields such as Test Case ID, Requirement ID, Priority, Severity, Test Type, Preconditions, Test Steps, Test Data, Expected Result, Actual Result, Status, Environment, and Defect ID. This structure ensures clarity, traceability, and easy execution, reflecting real-world QA practices.

The project focuses on validating functional behavior, UI/UX consistency, input validation, positive and negative scenarios, and cross-platform behavior for both web and mobile environments. It highlights the ability to think from an end-user perspective and identify potential issues before they impact usability or performance.
